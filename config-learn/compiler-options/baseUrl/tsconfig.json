    // Note that this feature does not change how import paths are emitted by tsc,
    // so paths should only be used to inform TypeScript that another tool has this
    // mapping and will use it at runtime or when bundling.

    // Hover on the from in the import statement will show where is source from
    // E.g. If change to "baseUrl": "../", "sub/b" will be resolved to "/Users/jiayi/Developer/ts-learn/config-learn/compiler-options/sub/b"
    // instead of "/Users/jiayi/Developer/ts-learn/config-learn/compiler-options/baseUrl/sub/b"
